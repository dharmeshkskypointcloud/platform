## What business problem does SkyPoint solve? 

In today’s business landscape, where digital transformation is constantly accelerating, companies face three main customer data challenges.

1. Too many data silos: When several data sources individually store customer data, the result is a fragmented view of the customer and broken identities.

2. The evolving data privacy concerns and regulations: Over the past few years, customers have lost trust in a business’s ability to protect their personal data. As a result, governments have stepped in to apply tough privacy regulations (e.g. CCPA, GDPR etc.) with severe legal and brand reputation risks if companies are caught out of compliance. Companies now need to understand the consent and the purpose of their customer data. This way, consent and purpose are not lost when customer data moves from its original location to several downstream systems.

3. Inability to manage large data volumes: Internal IT or point-to-point solutions cannot keep up with the volume, variety, and velocity of customer data generated by today’s plethora of digital touch points.
