# Throttling & Rate Limits

Throttling is the process responsible for regulating the rate at which the application processing is conducted. Throttling is a way to practically implement rate-limiting. It lets API developers control how their API is used by setting up a temporary state, allowing the API to assess each request. Rate Limits refers to controlling the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network. In this case, the rate limit for our API is set to be ***2000 requests/sec***. If the number of requests get above the threshold, then the requests after the threshold will get an error message responding that the request limit has reached.
