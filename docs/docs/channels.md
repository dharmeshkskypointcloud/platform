The three touch points allowed are:
1. Email : The email channel is used when you want to send emails from SkyPoint or from an integrated external emailing system and be able to track traffic from those emails to your other channels.
2. Mobile : The mobile channel refers to a native IOS or Android app. To interact with this app, this app needs to contain the SkyPoint mobile SDK for IOS or Andriod.
3. Website : A website is defined by a hostname-URL and its aliases. You enable SkyPoint for your website by adding a JavaScript snippet.
